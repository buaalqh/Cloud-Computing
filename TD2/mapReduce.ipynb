    "# First Part : Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is a programming model useful in for big data processing and allows running a parallel and distributed  algorithm on a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "A MapReduce algorithm is composed of:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> a map function, which performs a first set of operations on the input data and, usually, produces a set of key-value pairs as output  </li>\n",
    "    <li> a reduce function, which performs an operation on the data coming as output from the map function grouped on the basis of the key.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The MapReduce algorithm can be run on a framework (i.e. Hadoop). In this case the framework will handle the process of\n",
    "running the algorithm on the distributed architecture running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance. The map function and the reduce function will then become independent procedures running in multiple instances in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map and the reduce procedures can be seen then as two main functions: map() et reduce().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the map() function is seen as a function that:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> takes as input one (or a series) key/value pair(s);  </li>\n",
    "    <li> processes each key/value pair according to the procedure it implements;</li>\n",
    "    <li> generates as output zero or more key/value pairs.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> if the input data is composed by single values each sigle value can be seen as a key/value pair having an empty  value;  </li>\n",
    "    <li> the types of the input key/value pair and the output key/value pair(s) can be (and often are) different from each other;</li>\n",
    "    <li> output key/value pair can have a dummy key;</li>\n",
    "    <li> also the output key/value pair can have an empty value.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example shown in the slides the application is counting the number of occurrences of each word in the provided file. The map function would take as input a single line. This single line can be seen as a key/value pair having as key the whole line and as value an empty value. The function will break the line into words and output a key/value pair for each word. The key will be the string representing the word and the value will be the integer 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shuffle\n",
    "Between the map() and reduce() functions, the data are shuffled in order to move together data sharing the same key.\n",
    "Data will be then processed by the reduce function. \n",
    "When you run a MapReduce procedure on a framework the shuffle operation is fully and transparently handled by the framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduce\n",
    "The reduce() function applies a procedure on all the pairs that share the same key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> the reduce function produces zero or more outputs for each group of key-value pairs  </li>\n",
    "    <li> the type of the output can be different from the input and can be also one or a set of key/value pair(s);</li>\n",
    "    <li> even in this case the key/value pair can have an empty value.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the word count example, the reduce function takes the input values, sums them, and generates a single output containing a set of key/value pairs having as key the value of each word and as value the final sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Counting global number of elements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As first step you have as input some integers that are stored in multiple lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you have as input these lists: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = [4, 5, 6, 7]\n",
    "c = [8, 9, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible solution can run two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> a map function that gives as output the number of elements in each list; </li>\n",
    "(_,3)\n",
    "(_,4)\n",
    "(_,5) with the dummy key \"_\". \n",
    "    <li> a reduce function that adds the partial results coming from the map (using the dummy key) and returns 12</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first series of exercises we will learn how to write programs according to the MapReduce paradigm.\n"
